# A personal blog by a programmer called Teki

Since you were able to read this readme, I think u r a coder too :)
This is my personal blog, where I will upload some of my learning memo, mainly programming related but also some other topics (like ski, etc).
I'm currently living in Japan, so I may also upload some of my experiences traveling there.
There may be some blogs writing in Chinese, as I'm not particularly used to writing non-technical articles in English.
If you have questions about working as a programmer in Japan, or about my life, you can contact me via github or [contact me] button in the blog.
Hope you have a nice day!
Ps: This blog is built with reference to the youtube video below, the technology mainly uses astro and some basic javascript syntax, deployment uses github and vercel.
